Haptic Vibration Shield
=====================

Haptic vibration shield for Arduino: 4 vibration motors and the [TI DRV2603 haptic driver IC](http://www.ti.com/product/drv2603).

Above preview from boards ordered from [OSH Park](http://oshpark.com/) (a great way to get some if you want them). Created with generous assistance from Harvestworks' Cultural Innovation Fund program.

Note: the layout for the DRV2603 is (not quite yet) guaranteed. Please stay tuned!
